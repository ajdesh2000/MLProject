Instructions on how to train and test the three models. The resultant models after training however, are already present in the directories.

TASK1

Training the model:
1. Enter the Task1 directory
2. Activate the environment to be used
3. Run 'python Task1train.py' on the command line
4. Doing this saves model1.h5 model-file in the same directory. The model file trained by us is already present in this directory.

Testing the model:
1. Enter the Task1 directory
2. Activate the environment to be used
3. Run 'python Task1test.py <TEST_EPISODES>' on the command line. Here <TEST_EPISODES> is a command-line argument. In case no argument is provided, the default test episodes is assumed to be 100.
4. This loads model1.h5 and runs in on TEST_EPISODES number of episodes. Hence model1.h5 is a requirement to test the model.



TASK2

Training the model:
1. Enter the Task2 directory
2. Activate the environment to be used
3. Run 'python Task2train.py' on the command line
4. Doing this saves model2.h5 model-file in the same directory. The model file trained by us is already present in this directory.

Testing the model:
1. Enter the Task2 directory
2. Activate the environment to be used
3. Run 'python Task2test.py <TEST_EPISODES>' on the command line. Here <TEST_EPISODES> is a command-line argument. In case no argument is provided, the default test episodes is assumed to be 100.
4. This loads model2.h5 and runs in on TEST_EPISODES number of episodes. Hence model2.h5 is a requirement to test the model.



TASK3

Training the model:
1. Enter the Task3 directory
2. Activate the environment to be used
3. Run 'python Task3train.py' on the command line
4. Doing this saves model3.h5 model-file in the same directory. The model file trained by us is already present in this directory.

Testing the model:
1. Enter the Task3 directory
2. Activate the environment to be used
3. Run 'python Task3test.py <TEST_EPISODES>' on the command line. Here <TEST_EPISODES> is a command-line argument. In case no argument is provided, the default test episodes is assumed to be 100.
4. This loads model3.h5 and runs in on TEST_EPISODES number of episodes. Hence model3.h5 is a requirement to test the model.
